# 🧠 Architecture Explanation

## 📍 Routes Layer

Responsible for:

* Handling API endpoints
* Managing HTTP requests/responses
* Raising exceptions
* Connecting routes with services

---

## 📍 Services Layer

Responsible for:

* Business logic
* Data processing
* CRUD operations
* Database interactions

This separation keeps the code clean and maintainable.

---

## 📍 Models Layer

Responsible for:

* Data schemas
* Validation rules
* Request & response structure

---

## 📍 Database Layer

A fake in-memory database is used using Python dictionaries.

This is suitable for:

* Learning purposes
* Fast prototyping
* Understanding API flow
